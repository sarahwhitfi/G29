# G29-UE5-Room-Generator

### A Senior Design project written in C++ and uses an XML configuration file to perform random room generation with a seed that allows for player simulation.

This random room generator made in Unreal Engine 5 is a simulator that spawns random rooms based on some preset options with random assets in each room. A seed is stored for randomization that allows you to set it's value for a particular layout. It allows the user to experience the room generation in first-person.
